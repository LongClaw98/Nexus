# 🌐 Nexus

Welcome to my **Project Nexus** – a central hub where I showcase different types of projects across multiple domains.  
This repository brings together my work from platforms like **Kaggle, GitHub, Power BI, SQL, Python, and more**.  
Each project highlights a specific skill or toolset, and over time this repo will serve as my growing portfolio.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repo is meant to be a **consolidated showcase of diverse projects**.  
Instead of spreading work across multiple places, this space will act as a **single point of reference** for new project.

## 🚀 Future Additions
- **Kaggle notebooks** with links.  
- **end-to-end Python projects**.  
- **data engineering / analytics projects**.
